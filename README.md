## Token Lifecycle
```
403 Forbidden
{
    "message": "your current token has expired, please login again"
}
```
1. The token expires in 10 minutes. Can be configured to some other value by setting `JWT_EXPIRY_DURATION` env variable
2. In case you lose the access token, only admin has the authority to force expire your token
